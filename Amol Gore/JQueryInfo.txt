What is jQuery?

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

    HTML/DOM manipulation
    CSS manipulation
    HTML event methods
    Effects and animations
    AJAX
    Utilities

Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.
Why jQuery?

There are lots of other JavaScript frameworks out there, but jQuery seems to be the most popular, and also the most extendable.

Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

    Google
    Microsoft
    IBM
    Netflix

Definition and Usage

The ready event occurs when the DOM (document object model) has been loaded.

Because this event occurs after the document is ready, it is a good place to have all other jQuery events and functions. Like in the example above.

The ready() method specifies what happens when a ready event occurs.
=======================================================================
Syntax

Two syntaxes can be used: 
$(document).ready(function)

The ready() method can only be used on the current document, so no selector is required:
$(function)
